HPIPack 1.7 - HPI File Packer

HPIPack is a simple program allowing you to create your own HPI-format files.

To create an HPI file (or UFO or CCX or KMP or whatever), do the following:

1. Create a directory to contain the files you want to pack.

2. Create any necessary subdirectories.  For example, maps have to live in a
"maps" subdirectory.

3. Copy the files you want to pack into the new directory structure.

4. Run HPIPack, and give it the name of the directory, and the name of the 
HPI or UFO file to pack it into.

6. Select the program (TA or TAK).

7. Select the compression method.

8. Hit the "Pack" button.

Here's an example.  You have a nifty new map called AMAZO.  It has a TNT file, an OTA file,
and a TXT file describing it.  To pack them all up into a single AMAZO.UFO file, do this:

1. Create a directory called C:\PACK.

2. Create a MAPS subdirectory (C:\PACK\MAPS).

3. Copy AMAZO.TNT, AMAZO.OTA and AMAZO.TXT to C:\PACK\MAPS.

4. Run HPIPack.

5. Set the "Directory to pack" to C:\PACK

6. Set the "Destination HPI file" C:\Cavedog\Totala\AMAZO.UFO (or wherever you've
installed TA - You know the drill).

7. Select the program to pack for, either TA or TAK.

8. Select the compression method.  
   For TA, 'TA:CC' is faster and gives better results.
   For TAK, 'Auto' will compress files only if doing so will save space.

9. Hit the Pack button.

10. When it's done, clean out the PACK directory.

*******************************************************************************
                    IMPORTANT NOTE FOR TAK UNIT CREATION
*******************************************************************************

TA:Kingdoms requires a digital signature for playing "official" games.

In order to get the game to recognize third-party units, you must specify
the "-disablecavedogverification" command line option (without the quotes).

In multiplayer games, all players must have that option running or the unit won't
be available.

Command line operation

You can also operate HPIPack from the command line.

HPIPack [-d DirectoryToPack] [-f HPIFileName] [auto]

There has to be a space between the -d and -f options, and their file/directory
names.

The "auto" option tells the program to start packing automatically, and exit
when complete.  If this isn't there, it will wait for you to hit the pack button.

If you're going to use this in a batch file, use the 'start /w' command to make 
the batch file pause until the program is complete.

If you have any questions, please let me know!
