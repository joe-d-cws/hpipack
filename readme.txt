HPIPack Source Code notes

This program was compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0.

It's written in straight C - no C++ required.

However, it does require a knowledge of the Windows API.  An excellent
place to start is "Programming Windows 95" by Charles Petzold.

If you plan to modify the program, use GetMem and FreeMem to allocate and
free memory.  You can use malloc or GlobalAlloc if you want, but using 
GetMem and FreeMem will reduce memory fragmentation.

If you have any questions, just ask.

And if you DO make changes, I'd appreciate a copy of them.
